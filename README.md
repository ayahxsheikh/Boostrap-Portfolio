## Boostrap-Portfolio

This week I was able to re-create my portfolio using Bootstrap 4.4.
An exciting challenge tha taught me to use CSS features in Bootstrap and manipulate design to create a truly unique web-portfolio.
Being able to use Bootstrap confidently is a skill I hope to accomplish by the end of the bootcamp.
It is an important tool used by many front-end web companies and an important skill to consolidate when creating a prototype website for clients.
It saves time in comparison to creating a website from scratch and is an essential initial stage when understanding client needs.

I have re-designed some areas from my previous portfolio to incorporate a better suited design for myself.

## Installation

n/a

## Usage 
The website should be easy to nagvigate.
The code includes HTML semantics and has modified the linked type selectors in the CSS file.
The site should clearly showcase my projects and this gives employers a good perspective of what my coding and UI abilities are capable of.
